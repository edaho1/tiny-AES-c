Perform Sbox operations: Sbox[Data XOR Keybyte]
Data is store in CTR_128_intermediateVal 
CTR_128_intermediateval need to be clean before it can be process. We clean it by passing the values to the deblank and then to the hex_decoder. 
Keybytes are generated on the fly as they are guesses that need to be made. The guesses should have range [0:255]

Perform Hamming Weight operations:
The hamming weight is a generic model used bitcount(uint8_t input)
